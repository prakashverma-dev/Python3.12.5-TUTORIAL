# RoadMap : -

First Part : We firtsly understand all theoritical knowlodeg and working.
Second Part : Take Each DS and Solve Problems From Each DS and ALgo along with TIme and SPace Complexity.


1. Introduction of DSA (What is DS and Algo)
2. Types of Data Struture
3. Array DataStruture
4. Time and Space Complexity
5. Searching  Algo(Linear Search and Binary Search)
6. All Sorting Algo (Buuble Sorting, Selection Sort, etc.)
7. Then Cover the Rest Data STruture like STack, Queue.



# In DSA Learning What We Gonna Cover : -

1) We are going to learn following 5 Algorithms IN DSA :-

Search Algo - Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

Sort Algo - Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

Insert Algo - Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

Update Algo - Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

Delete Algo -  Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.


2) Types of Data Structures :- Here are different type of data structures which we are going to learn in this tutorial:

# The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures - 

Fibonacci number series
Knapsack problem
Tower of Hanoi
All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
Shortest path by Dijkstra
Project scheduling


# Asymptotic Analysis  : - Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical foundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

Usually, the time required by an algorithm falls under three types : -

Best Case - Minimum time required for program execution.

Average Case - Average time required for program execution.

Worst Case - Maximum time required for program execution.
