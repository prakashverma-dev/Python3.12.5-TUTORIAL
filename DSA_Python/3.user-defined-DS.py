''' User-defined Data Struture : -

# i) Stack DA : Imagine Somehting stored one upon another order like book stored one by one.

It Works on basis of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. means Jo Last Me Enter Kiya Hai woh pehle Nikalega stack se.

In Stack DA, Elements can be added(known as pushing), removed(known as popping) and accessed.

Elements are accessed only from the top position only. Not from any mid position. E.g : Books stores as in Stack order one upton another. So iN stack to access third eleemnt we need to remove first, second then we finally access third one.Not directlt 3rd one.


ii) Queue DA : Imagine People standing in queue for movie tickets, atm, or in market.

first Come, first take service.

It works on the basis of First-In-First-Out(FIFO) principle. means Jo First Enter Kiya hai, wahi nikalege Queue se first me. 

Queues have both head and tail sections that means in Queue DA, operation can be perfomed first the first or back as well either side.
 
Head of Queue means first element which will operated and tail means last element which will be operated.



iii) Tree DA : It is also one of the user-defined DA. think about a tree having root and leaves. Here, In Tree DA, a root represents a data.

Trees DA have nodes, root node and leaves nodes.

When new nodes/data generated from the node, that node called as root node.

When the node in Tree DA doesnot not any further nodes then that node called as leave node.


Every node that proceeds another node is called as Parent Node and Proceeded Node called as CHild Nodes. SO there is concept of Parent-Children Relationship nodes in Tree DA.

iv) Graph DA : think Graph like a connected Data. Graph DA also have Nodes and Edges(Sides).

A graph has a collection of nodes and edges.

In Graph DA, Nodes are also called as Vertices and edges(Sides) also called as arcs.

A valid Graph DA consists of Finite Set of Nodes and edges, not infinite nodes or edeges.

Example : Each people on facebook, Instagram, Twitter is connected with each other like a Graph DA where each person is Vertices or Nodes to each other in the network and Edges is the space between respective each other or co-relation in the network.


v) Linked Lists : - It the special type of user-defined datatype, It consists of elements tht are connected or linked with each other with 'Poiter'.

Pointer : Pointer referes to the address of the element where we have pointed coz by which without knowing elemnt we can get the element with adress of it.

POinter is simply a address system we attach to varible so that even tho we do not know the value but with knowing pointer/address of it, we can get the value or item from Linked-List DA.

Python does not have inbuilt linked-list in its standard library, Implementation has to be done using lists manually.
