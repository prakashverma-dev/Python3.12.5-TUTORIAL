# Types of Data-Structure In Python Based on Nature  : -

1) Primitive Data Structure : They store the data of only one type. It is the basic way of representing data that contains simple values. Data types like integer, float, string, and booleans, none come in this category.

2) Non-Primitive Data Structures: They don't just store a value, but rather a collection of values in various formats. They can store data of more than one type.

Non-primitive data structures can further be categorized into two categories:

 a) Built-In: Python offers implicit support for built-in structures that enable storing and accessing data e.g. lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

 Buit-In Data structure are those which comes with python programming lang we do not need to use any external module.


 b) User-Defined: Python also provides the functionality to create your own data structures e.g. Stack, Queue, Array, LinkeList, Hashmap, Tree, Graph. so that you can have full control over their functionality.

User-defined Data structure are those which doesnot comes with python programming lang we need to either require externally or make it.

Note : We will mainly study, Built-in Daatstruture and UserDefined Daat struture in the DSA series.


# Python Built-In Data Structures : List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary

i) List : 
ii) Tuple  : 
iii) Set  : 
iv) Dictionary  : 

# Python User-Defined Data Strutures : Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList, HashMap, Tree, Graph.

i) Array : Static Array and Dynamic Array
ii) Stack
iii) Queue
iv) Linked List
v) Hash Map
vi) Tree
vii) Graph

# Types of Data-Structure In Python Based on Linearity and NOn-Learnity  : -

a) Linear Data-Struture : Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList
b) Non-Linear Data-Struture : Graphs, Trees


## In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
