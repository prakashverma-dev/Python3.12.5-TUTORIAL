#What is DSA In Programming Language :-

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches us how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

It the backbone for solving difficult problems efficiently with best possible solution with optimizing time complexicity and space complexcity of the problem. 

Using the right data structure and algorithm makes our program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.


Learning Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) is not specific to any programming language, i.e DSA is indepenent of programming language, you can do/learn DSA in any follwoing programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java,JavaScript.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Data Structure : Data Struture refers to the way 'how data is stored, organized, and managed in different strutures with efficient manner and accessing them as and when required. 

It can includes built-in types like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, which help in handling data efficiently as well as user-defined data structures like tree, graph, queue, etc.

Data Storage, organization, accessibility and efficiency are at major factors of storing data.


How to Choose Which Which Data Struture is best to store data :  we store data depending on what data we have, uses and what we want to do with it. Suppose, We want to store data about a family, then we choose Tree Datastructure to store their data as per family tree like granfather, grandmother, father, moth etc. like family hirachy tree.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------


## What is Algorithms :-  Algorithms is the way of working with data and 'how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.

Algorithm examples:

Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
Finding what users search for (search engine)
Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating



#Theory and Terminology : -  

i) Algorithm : A set of step-by-step instructions to complete/solve a specific problem.
ii) Data Structure : A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.

iii) Time Complexity : A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

iv) Space Complexity : A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

v) Big O Notation :	A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.

vi) Recursion :	A programming technique where a function calls itself.

vii) Divide and Conquer : A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.

viii) Brute Force :	A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Usually we are more concerned with time and space in the momory.

#Asymptotic Notation : It is a methemactical way of representing the time and space complexcity of an algorithm without execution on prior analysis of it.

How to calculate it without execution of algorithm : No of times any statement took place to complete the problme i.e iritation/frequency or no of times function calling to complete the problem.

By this we can determine different algorithm time complexicity and then we choose the best algo for our problem to solve.

Asymptotic NOtation are three types based on algorithm -

a) For Worst case : Big Oh(O) 
b) For Best case : Big-Omega(omega sign) 
c) For Average case : Theta(Thetha sign)
