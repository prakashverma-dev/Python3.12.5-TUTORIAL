#What are the Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) In Computer Science :-

Before that Let's See Data -

Data : Entire software industry based on Data and Data is everything in software industry. E.g: a) We learn programming lang to process the data b) why we use Database to store data.

# What is Data Structure : In Programming, we have primitive datatypes which generally used for storing different kind of data as single value but when we want to store more than single value we need to use Data Structure to store complex data in organize way and efficient way that is Data Structure in programming. 

In General, Data Structures are programming's non-primitive Datatypes or ABT(Abstract Data Types) where we can store complex data in organize way and efficient way in terms of more than one value.

# Data Structure Definition : Data Structures is a way to store complex data efficiently and in more organized way which could manage efficiently with accessing them with time efficiently.

There are multiple data structure we have like Arrays, Stack, Queue, List, set , Linked List, Tree, Graph et. Some of it are Python inbuilt DS and some are user-defined Data Structures.

Here, Efficiently means two things a) In terms of Performance;  and   b) In terms of Memory.

# What are Algorithms : Algorithm is "Set of Instruction"defined In programming language to achive the desire task, also known as Pseudo Code.

Ex: Add two value from user -

Steps : Take Two numbers from user ----> add ---> return sum; (Called as Pseudo code)

Note : We need to convert pseudo code into any programing langue like pyhon, java etc. to work. These pseudo called as algorithm that is "steps to achieve the problem solution".



# Lets Understand why one should know DSA : -

i) Most of companies focusing on the concept of DSA coz want to give good experince to users by making loads website fast and saving memory space.

Ii) By  Knowing DS is help to result cost of the company. EX: For take Instagram example: Whenever user do each queries or computation on insta, then for user's each computation meta(owner of insta) has to pay some money to database owner like AWS cloud for user's each query. 

So, They try to optimize with help of DSA as suppose, each query by a user takes $0.5; can we reduce it to $0.1 by makig sure using right data struture with right alogirth.
Hence, to give cosumter good  experience for each computaion search experince.


Points to Keep Remember : -

i) Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches us how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

ii) It the backbone for solving difficult problems efficiently with best possible solution with optimizing time complexicity and space complexcity of the problem. 

iii) Using the right data structure and algorithm makes our program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

iv) Choosing Right Data Structure to store data is very important in DSA. we store data depending on what data we have, uses and what we want to do with it. Suppose, We want to store data about a family, then we choose Tree Datastructure to store their data as per family tree like granfather, grandmother, father, moth etc. like family hirachy tree.


v) Learning Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) is not specific to any programming language, i.e DSA is indepenent of programming language, you can do/learn DSA in any follwoing programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java,JavaScript.



# Use-Cases of Using DSA : -

For managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.
For scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.
For planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.
For optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.
For solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.
