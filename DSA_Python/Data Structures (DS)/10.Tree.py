# Tree DataStructure : Tree DS is also similar like LinkedList where data stored in each nodes and can be linked to other nodes but Tree DS is not linear data struture like LinkedList, Tree is hierarchical data structure where this data strcuture forms Tree Struture having nodes conneted by edges, also have -

a) Nodes : Nodes is something where we store our data and address/reference of next node we store.

b) Parent and  Child : A node can have childs and that node will called as Parent./A Parent have childs and Childs have single parent.

A node can have zero, one, or many child nodes.

A node can only have one parent node.


c) Root : When a particular node who doesnot have any Parent that node known as Root (root node). root node is the start node of TRee Data struture Remember.

d) Edge : A LINE which connects Parnt and child called Edge or A line which connects any two nodes.

d) Leaf : When a Parent or  A node doesnot have any child, that known as Leaf(Leaf oNode) of Tree DS where Tree DS gets terminated. 

e) Depth : To Reach to a Particular Node from Root Node how many edges we need to travel called Depth, So we count the no of edges taken to rech our chosen node called as Depth for that Choosen Node. We denote Root as Zero Level and then followd by till chosen node and We declare the depth of choosen node by Assigned Level. (e.g: d = 2)

f) Height : Height we consider as Tree Height which can be calculated by reaching to last Leaf Node which have the highes depth. And We declare it as Tree Height in level of leaf node. /Longest Edge Connected till leaf node, then count the no of edges. (e.g: h = 3)

h) SubTree : We can make subTrees from Main Tree then Substree have their own root node.

i) Tree Size : Total no of Nodes present in the tree.(e.g: n = 10)



## We have previously covered data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. These are all linear structures, which means that each element follows directly after another in a sequence. Trees however, are different. In a Tree, a single element can have multiple 'next' elements, allowing the data structure to branch out in various directions.

The data structure is called a "tree" because it looks like a tree's structure.


The Tree data structure can be useful in many cases: -

Hierarchical Data: File systems, organizational models, etc.
Databases: Used for quick data retrieval.
Routing Tables: Used for routing data in network algorithms.
Sorting/Searching: Used for sorting data and searching for data.
Priority Queues: Priority queue data structures are commonly implemented using trees, such as binary heaps.



# Types of Tree Data Structure : - Thre are mainly three types of Data Struture 

i) Binary Tree : When a Tree where maximum no of child nodes is 2.(minimum can have zero or 1 child nodes but maximum only two nodes), Called Binary Tree , It is one type of Tree Data Struture.

Each node has upto max two children, the left child node and the right child node. and  could have either one null.


ii) Binary Search Tree(BST) : It is a type of Binary Tree, means have maximum two nodes but In Binary Search Tree DS also holds where left Child Nodes have lower values than root node and the right child nodes have higher values than root node. 

Eg: 8,7,12,15,2,5

Uses: When you want to search a particular element in from entire tree, It is better to store in Binary Search Tree DAta STructure.
