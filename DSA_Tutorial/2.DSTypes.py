# Data Types :- In Programming, DataTypes can be divided into two Types :-

a) Primitive DataTypes : - It is datatypes to store single value in the variable like int, string, float, complex, boolean, None .


b) Non-Primitive DataTypes or Abstract Data Type(ADT) or Data Structure (DS) : -  

Non-Primitive Dataypes are those which store more than one data at time in terms of collection like list, array, stack , queue, etc.  kwown as 'Data Struture' Programming.

Abstract Data Type defines in way that it is a Non-primitive Datatypes where we do not concern about its internal implementaion of data struture but we concern about how its working about storing multiple data and performing different opetions on it.

Examples of ADTs : Stack, Queue, List, Linked List, Set.

In one line: ADT = What 'a data structure should do', not 'how it is built'. 


## In General, Data Structure In Programming Divided into two Types : -

a) Linear Data Structure :- The data is stored in linear data structures sequentially or manner. These are the data structures which store the data elements in a sequential manner.

Ex: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Matrix, Python List.

b) Non-Learn Data Structure : - Non-Linear data structures store the data in the form of a hierarchy. Therefore, here data can be found in multiple levels and are difficult to traverse through.

These are the data structures in which there is no sequential linking of data elements. Any pair or group of data elements can be linked to each other and can be accessed without a strict sequence.


Ex: Binary Tree, Heap, Hash Table, Graph.// Graph, Tree, Maps, Tries.

# Python Inbuilt Data Structures : These data structures are specific to python language and they give greater flexibility in storing different types of data and faster processing in python environment - List, tuple, Dictionary, Set.




## Based on the data storage methods, these linear data structures are divided into two sub-types. They are - static and dynamic data structures.

i) Static Linear Data Structures: In Static Linear Data Structures, the memory allocation is not scalable. Once the entire memory is used, no more space can be retrieved to store more data. Hence, the memory is required to be reserved based on the size of the program. This will also act as a drawback since reserving more memory than required can cause a wastage of memory blocks.

The best example for static linear data structures is an array.

ii) Dynamic Linear Data Structures : In Dynamic linear data structures, the memory allocation can be done dynamically when required. These data structures are efficient considering the space complexity of the program.

Few examples of dynamic linear data structures include: Python List, linked lists, stacks and queues.



# On any Learn Data Struture We can perform follwoing operation -

a) READ Operation
b) Search Operation
c) Add Operation
d) Delete Operation
